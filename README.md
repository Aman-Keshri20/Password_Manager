# Password Manager
A very basic project developed using HTML, CSS and PHP to save a user's passwords of all websites at one place.

The front end gives an user to Register, Log In and once either of the two procedures are done, a dashboard appears. This dashboard gives the user options to either add a new password record to the backend database or to find a particular record from the database.

The fields provided for entering records are: Domain Name of the website, Username on the website to be added, Password on the website to be added. 
The record is found by entering the Domain Name of the website. Once it is entered, the webpage gives you the username and password of that particular website.

Access the project source-code files which are named according to their function. 

Note: 
The project has some bugs and is not completely optimized for industrial use.
